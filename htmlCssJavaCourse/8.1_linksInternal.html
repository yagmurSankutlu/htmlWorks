    <h1>Internal Links</h1>
    <section>Internal links point to internal web pages of the where 
    application, the links we are showing are all relative URL links.
    In this sample we are using links to the same web application 
    that we are in.
    </section>
    <section>
        We can link to a file in the same directory as this HTML file
        like this:
        <a href="8.0_same-directory.html" title="same dir link"> Linking 
                to a file in the same directory </a>
             <!--href stands for hyeprtext reference href can either be a relative or an absolute URL -->
             <!--"Linking to a file in the same directory"is an inline tag since it is not forcing itself 
             to go to a new line-->
        <a href="8.0_same-directory.html" title="same dir link">  
             <!--title attribute is used by the screen readers that help the visually impaired(gÃ¶rme engelli)
             people get through the web page-->
            <div> DIV Linking to a file in the same directory</div> 
        </a>
             <!--In between the opening and closing the "a" tags is the content we are going to see 
             in the web page, when it is served and on which we are going to be able to click to go
             to the href that the "a" tag is configurated with -->
             <!--"DIV linking to a file in the same directory" we are surrounded our "div" tag with "a" tag
             We used block level element, the "div", inside an inline element and this is correct usage of "a" 
             because "a" is both a flow content and a phrasing content. In other words "a" tag is both an inline
             element and a block level element at the same time-->
