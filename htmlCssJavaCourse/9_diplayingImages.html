    <!--The image is displayed in HTML using this "img" tag which is just short
    for image. "img" tag is an inline element that's mean it cannot push nothing 
    behind it onto a new line-->
    <!-- "src" attribute of the "img" tag is a URL that points to some image file-->

    impairment-->

        <p>&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out
        how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could
        have done them better. The credit belogs to the man who is 
        actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat
        and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short 
        again and again, becouse there is no effort without error and
        shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
        who knows grest enthisuasms, the great devotions; who spends
        himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end 
        the triamph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he 
        fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place
        shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know
        victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;</p>
