       <h3>(#section1) Section 1 </h3>
       <h4>Topic Introduction</h4>
       <p>The focus of this course is the study of electricity and magnetism. Basically, this is the study 
        of how charges interact with each other. We study these interactions using the concept of 
        “fields” which are both created by and felt by charges. Today we introduce fields in general 
        as mathematical objects, and consider gravity as our first “field.” We then discuss how 
        electric charges create electric fields and how those electric fields can in turn exert forces on 
        other charges. The electric field is completely analogous to the gravitational field, where 
        mass is replaced by electric charge, with the small exceptions that (1) charges can be either 
        positive or negative while mass is always positive, and (2) while masses always attract, 
        charges of the same sign repel (opposites attract). </p>

    <h3>(#section2) Section 2 </h3>
    <h4>Scalar Fields </h4>
    <p> A scalar field is a function that gives us a single value of some variable for every point in 
        space – for example, temperature as a function of position. We write a scalar field as a scalar 
        function of position coordinates – e.g. T(x, y, z), T(r ,θ ,ϕ), or, more generically, T(r).

    <section id="section3">
        <h3>(#section3) Section 3 </h3>
        <h4>Vector Fields </h4>
        <p> A vector is a quantity which has both a magnitude and a direction in space (such as velocity 
            or force). A vector field is a function that assigns a vector value to every point in space – for 
            example, wind speed as a function of position. We write a vector field as a vector function of
            position coordinates </p>

    <section id="section4">
        <h3>(#section4) Section 4 </h3>
        <h4>Gravitational Fields </h4>
        <p>As a first example of a physical vector field, we recall the gravitational force between two 
            masses. This force can be broken into two parts: the generation of a “gravitational field” 
            g by the first mass, and the force that that field exerts on the second mass (F=mg).
            This way of thinking about forces – that objects create fields and that other objects 
            then feel the effects of those fields – is a generic one that we will use throughout the course.

    <section id="section5">
        <h3>(#section5) Section 5 </h3>
        <h4>Electric Fields </h4>
        <p>Every charge creates around it an electric field, proportional to the size of the charge and 
        decreasing as the inverse square of the distance from the charge. If another charge enters this
        electric field, it will feel a force (F = qE).

    <!--Another way is, if we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the page
    is to create an anchor tag with a name attribute and name the section very 
    similary to the way you name a section id. Put a # sign in front of the name
    of the section and stick that value in the href attribute of an anchor tag. -->
